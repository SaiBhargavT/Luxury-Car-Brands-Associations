# Luxury-Car-Brands-Associations
This group project has been done as part of the Unstructured Data Analytics course taken during the Masters program in Business Analytics at the University of Texas at Austin. It involved using NLTK bag of words approach on text data to identify the usually mentioned together car brands by calculating lift scores and plotting MDS plot based on how closely each of the brands are associated with each other.
